# Synacor Challenge

The [Synacor Challenge](https://web.archive.org/web/20230206005149/https://challenge.synacor.com/) was an online programming puzzle created by [Eric Wastl](https://x.com/ericwastl), the mind behind [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

This repository contains an unmodified archive of my original challenge files now that the official website has been retired. It serves as a reference for those wanting to explore the challenge on their own.

## Files

- [arch-spec](arch-spec) - Architecture specification
- [challenge.bin](challenge.bin) - Challenge binary

## Codes

As you progress through the challenge, you will encounter eight unique codes. Below are their MD5 hashes for verification. To check a code, use an MD5 hashing tool. For example:


```
$ echo -n "<your_code>" | md5sum
4e0e1b861a544012961ad1a336ac863c  -
```
